    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>LPA was founded in 1983</strong>.<br />
      It used to teach the subjects of the national curriculum via the English
      language.<br />
      <strong
        >It stopped doing so at the end of the scholar year 1989-1990</strong
      >,<br />
      in a bid to 'linguistically' equate LPA students with their peers
      attending mainstream high schools nationwide,<br />
      who are taught the (same) scientific subjects in the French language.<br />
      Students used to get in at the age of twelve. At the time, the school had
      7 different grades.<br />
      But following national educational reforms, the secondary education has
      been split into two parts.<br />
      <strong
        >LPA is now open to intermediate school graduates (15 and 16-year-olds)
        <br />who have guaranteed outstanding passage of the end-of-basic-
        school entrance examination</strong
      ><br />
      with an average mark exceeding 16 out of 20.
      <br /><strong>Schooling used to last 7 years at LPA until 1995</strong
      >,<br />
      and now lasts 4 years :<br />
      <strong>1st year:</strong> “Common Core”.<br />
      <strong>2nd year:</strong>: “Sciences”, after first round of streaming.<br />
      <strong>3rd year:</strong> and 4th year: “Experimental sciences or
      “Maths”, after second round of streaming.
