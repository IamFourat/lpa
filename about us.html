      LPA was founded in 1983. It used to teach the subjects of the national
      curriculum via the English language. It stopped doing so at the end of the
      scholar year 1989-1990, in a bid to 'linguistically' equate LPA students
      with their peers attending mainstream high schools nationwide, who are
      taught the (same) scientific subjects in the French language. Students
      used to get in at the age of twelve. At the time, the school had 7
      different grades. But following national educational reforms, the
      secondary education has been split into two parts. LPA is now open to
      intermediate school graduates (15 and 16-year-olds) who have guaranteed
      outstanding passage of the end-of-basic- school entrance examination, with
      an average mark exceeding 16 out of 20, that is. Schooling used to last 7
      years at LPA until 1995, and now lasts 4 years : 1st year: “Common Core”.
      2nd year: “Sciences”, after first round of streaming. 3rd year and 4th
      year: “Experimental sciences or “Maths”, after second round of streaming.
